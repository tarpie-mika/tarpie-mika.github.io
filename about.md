        Hi I'm Mika (or Tarpie)!<br>
        She/her/it, pan🍳<br>

            I'm just a gal in my 20's living my best doggy tranny life.<br>
            I have a background in electrical engineering, and work with trains(!!). I have two 3d printers, 
            a good old Prusa i3 MK3, and a newer Prusa CORE ONE kit. I would include a picture of them but the workshop is really messy right now... ^^'
            <br><br>
            I build nerf blasters and I'll include some pictures in a post or something idk. 
            Stick around and see what i come up with! This page will most likely just contain whatever is
            interesting to me at the minute.

            I hardly know what I'm doing, but I got this much done <span class="emoji">✨</span>
