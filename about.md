        Hi i'm Mika (or tarpie)!<br>
        She/her/it, pan🍳<br>

            <p>
                I'm just a gal in my 20's living my best doggy tranny life.<br>
                I have a background in electrical engineering, and work with trains(!!). I have two 3d printers, 
                a good old Prusa i3 MK3, and a newer Prusa CORE ONE kit.<br>
                I would include a picture of them but the workshop is really messy right now... ^^'
            </p>
            <p>
                I build nerf blasters and I'll include some pictures in a post or something idk. 
                Stick around and see what i come up with! This page will most likely just contain whatever is
                interesting to me at the minute.
