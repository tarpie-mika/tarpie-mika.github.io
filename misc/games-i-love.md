			Games eh? 
		</p>
		<div class="boxInvis">
			So, I play a lot of games. Not as many as some, but maybe more than average? Point is I like a good gaming
			experience, and while I'm no great writer, I'll write a bit about my favourites here. Picking favourites can be hard, so it won't be
			and exhaustive list, but I'll try to keep it updated if I stumble upon something that really stands out. I guess
			I'll start with the freshest one in my mind right now...

			I don't think I can name one other game that evoked the same feelings in me that this game did.
			It's one of those games that you can't really revisit. Until someone invents a machine to delete
			specific memories (or you hit your head really hard (don't!)), I cannot get this experience ever again.
			The feelings of discovery and mystery, trying to piece this game together... It's something I'll remember
			for a long time, but I can never re-experience those feelings. I completed the game, I know everything
			I need to know to piece it all together. There are practically nothing new for me to find in the game.
			<br><br>

			In the game you're in a neverending time loop, and until you break it, the game feels like it can go on forever.
			But of course it can't. When it the game ended I cried. It had been a journey, I felt connected to the games world, its beauty and its terrors.
			The characters I felt like I had gotten to know. As soon as the credits rolled I jumped in that spaceship again, ready to tackle the DLC.
			And the DLC is great (albeit a tad more spooky), but now that is complete too. Everything ends, and this had to as well. I was just lucky
			enough to experience it.
			<br><br>

			Life might feel endless at times, but we're lucky to have it and you can never experience it again.
			Now go get your own spaceship and blast off into the wilderness. It'll be worth it, I promise.
